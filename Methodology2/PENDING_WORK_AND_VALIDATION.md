# Methodology 2 — Pending Work and Validation Status

This revision completed the source-level and runtime-independent work and made
the detection/mitigation logic configurable and unit-tested. It does **not**
claim a complete live Mininet-WiFi / Ryu / SUMO validation, because that
privileged wireless runtime was not available in the preparation environment.

## Done and verified without the testbed

* Dependency-free Paillier crypto, privacy-preserving aggregation and encrypted
  DoS-evidence pipeline, with unit tests and real micro-benchmarks.
* Mobility feature loading/validation, mobility-aware threshold selection with a
  documented base-threshold fallback and a stale-sample age guard.
* Sliding-window rate estimation with a corrected early-window divisor.
* Progressive-mitigation decision state machine (Stage 0→1→2, hold, and
  reset/recovery) with unit tests.
* 45 unittest cases + the 5 original check scripts all pass:
  `bash Methodology2/run_tests.sh`.

## Source-level fixes that STILL require live confirmation

1. **AP2 OpenFlow port assumptions.** Stage 1/2 flows match `in_port=1` and
   output `port=2` on AP2 by default. Confirm against
   `ovs-ofctl -O OpenFlow13 show ap2` and set `DOS_AP2_IN_PORT` /
   `DOS_AP2_OUT_PORT` before interpreting mitigation behaviour.
2. **Stage 1 meter enforcement.** The committed `final_evidence/final_meter_stats.txt`
   reports `flow_count: 0` and zero meter counters. The meter flow now also
   mirrors matching packets to the controller so rate observation continues and
   Stage 2 can escalate, but a fresh run must show a matching meter flow with
   non-zero counters while legitimate traffic stays usable.
3. **Stage 2 expiry and recovery.** The indefinite 20 s re-block was removed and
   replaced with a self-expiring block plus a detector reset. Confirm with a
   live attack that the drop counters rise during the attack and that traffic
   recovers after the hard timeout.
4. **End-to-end connectivity.** Live testing confirmed one concrete cause:
   ap1's wireless interface was missing from its OVS bridge (ap2's was present).
   The topology now attaches each AP's wlan port idempotently and verifiably via
   `ensure_ap_wireless_port()` (see `CONNECTIVITY_FIX.md`). A second, still-open
   symptom is sta2/sta3 not associating (interfaces down); this is a radio-layer
   issue, addressed with `bring_up_stations()` plus the configurable
   `DOS_PROP_EXP` / `DOS_AP_RANGE` / `DOS_AP_TXPOWER` knobs, and must be
   confirmed in the VM. Resolve both before interpreting mitigation, and do NOT
   mask them with a high-priority bypass forwarding rule.
5. **Mobility clock alignment.** SUMO sample time starts at 0 while the
   controller uses process-elapsed time. The stale-sample guard
   (`DOS_MOBILITY_MAX_AGE`) prevents far-away rows from adjusting the threshold,
   but for faithful experiments start the mobility producer and controller in a
   coordinated way or add an explicit simulation-time offset.
6. **Mobility input is a static trace.** The shipped/produced feature CSV is a
   recorded trace, not evidence that the controller is receiving live mobility
   updates.

## Required live validation before claiming completion

* Verify station association and `sta1 -> sta2` ping before any attack.
* Capture `ovs-ofctl -O OpenFlow13 show ap1`, `show ap2`, and `dump-flows ap2`.
* Run a normal-traffic baseline and record packet loss, latency, throughput.
* Run UDP attack traffic and verify the controller's detection rate/window.
* Confirm the Stage 1 meter has a matching flow with non-zero counters and that
  legitimate traffic remains usable.
* Confirm Stage 2 drop counters increase during a fresh attack and that the
  block expires and traffic recovers afterward.
* Repeat for both urban and highway scenarios, saving configs, commands and
  machine-readable outputs.
* Report Paillier aggregation results separately from the live SDN results.

## Paillier / cryptography limitations

* Additive homomorphism only. The controller does not and cannot compare
  ciphertexts directly; the detection threshold is applied by the authorised
  decryptor *after* decrypting the aggregate.
* Confidentiality is not integrity or authenticity. A compromised observer can
  submit a false but in-range contribution. Observer authentication, replay
  protection and contribution integrity are out of scope for this module and
  remain future work.
* The demonstration keys are small. Re-benchmark with >= 2048-bit keys and a
  reviewed cryptographic library before making any security-performance claim.
* The aggregation module is a separately-testable component with a documented
  interface; it is intentionally NOT integrated into the live controller's fast
  path. Integration is future work.
